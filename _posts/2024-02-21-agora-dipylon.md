Project Dipylon was named after the Greek gate leading to the Agora marketplace.

### Agora (ἀγορά), Dipylon (Δίπυλον), and Dromos (δρόμος)?

The [Ancient Agora of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Agora_of_Athens) was a central marketplace and gathering space in a city-state. It served as a hub for economic, political, social, and cultural activities. The Agora was typically located near the city center and was surrounded by important public buildings, temples, and shops.

The [Dipylon Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipylon), named after the nearby Dipylon Cemetery, was a significant structure in the Agora of ancient Athens. It served as one of the main entrances to the city and was located on the road leading from the city's port, Piraeus, to the Agora and the city center.

The Dromos was an important thoroughfare in the urban landscape of ancient Greek cities, serving practical, symbolic, and ceremonial functions within the city's infrastructure and social fabric.
